# Web-hack
We are the Team WebHack. This is a official repository for the project submission.

Our vision to provide all educational needs under a single roof.

In this COVID -19 pandemic, all the educational institutions are closed. 

Due to that, The teachers give their classes in online mode. Many of the students don't attend the meeting at that time due to bad weather condition or some other tasks. This could be a very bad condition for them in the upcoming future.

So We will provide a better solution for both students as well as teachers.

1. So In our service package, we will provide the video uploaded by the teachers and we will provide the practice question sets where the student can use those video lectures clarifying the topic and clear the concepts by practicing the model questions.

2. It is not only for the students but this platform is also helpful for the schools and organizations. It is a complete package for the students as well as the teachers. Here the schools or organizations can conduct their exam in a fair manner by using our webcam service. We will provide the programming question for the interested student to enhance their coding skills. we will also provide the community where the
students can help others to solve their doubts.

3. Due to this lockdown period, the students might not be able to clarify their concepts properly so we will provide the practice question sets where the student can practice, and in the end, they have to give the qualifying test to check their potential and knowledge on the concepts.

4. In our virtual learning platform, we will provide the 24 hours doubt clearing service where the students can clear their doubts by our experts and we will also provide a chatbot service for quick clarification.

5. In this pandemic time, this platform could be the best place for learners where all the facilities are available under one roof.
